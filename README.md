Group week application

## Specifications

Hey guys!

The idea with this program is to take input from a person in regards to how far they travel in a week (in miles and or days per week?), using which kind of transportation(car, bike, bus, lightrail, walk, others?), household energy utilities (natural gas, oil, electricity, propane), waste creation vs recycling, and what kind/how much meat they consume to roughly see how much carbon they emit. A quick google search resulted in a similar calculator being available online at the epa website (their result is CO2, but if we prefer Carbon it's a simple equation): https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/

The epa website is pretty in depth. I don't think we should go so far as to ask for how much in dollars people spend on heating and cooling for example. I see our project as being a straight forward, educational tool that can be helpful for our portfolios once we leave epicodus.

book with reference to economies of scale within a household (epa's calculator indicates a 1:1 for households with multiple people, that for larger households utility cost doesn't decrease per person, which is crazy, so this book shows evidence that utilities can be decreased anywhere from 20-40% on a per person scale with larger households, not definitive but worth a shake- usa is probably on the lower end of these numbers though) https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfe8ukMh_v4C&pg=PA262&lpg=PA262&dq=number+of+people+in+household+effects+utilities&source=bl&ots=YlRgmFSegO&sig=3ZpWTEvLYrS1nNhjto2AvOyCqy0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPsOrC6JXTAhVCyGMKHR8hDIgQ6AEIUDAI#v=onepage&q=utility%20cost&f=false
