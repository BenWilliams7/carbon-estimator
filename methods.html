      <h2 class="intro">Our methods behind the numbers</h2>
        <p>Our calculations are based on finding the price per given unit for home energy. The price indicates how much of that energy was consumed in the home, and we then calculate the carbon pollution for that amount of usage. We have worked to find prices accurate for the greater Portland area. Calculations for the amount of energy per dollar were based on pricing from PG&E. Natural gas per dollar was based on pricing from NWNatural. Fuel oil was harder to find consistent numbers for. Prices varied greatly depending on supplier or on how much fuel was purchased. Our pricing was based on $2.95 per gallon, which is a middle-of-the-road figure taken from Best Heating Oil's pricing for a purchase of 100 gallons or more. <br>
        More accurate results could be drawn from users knowing the exact amount of elecrticity or heating method that they use. We decided to calculate based on pricing in order to emphasize accessibility as we found that more people were aware of their monthly bill than of the units of fuel that they used over the same period. <br>
        The pollution from electricity use can vary greatly depending upon the state. This is because some states have more renewable production in their supplies than others. The electricity grid for the North West (922.3 lb/MWh) produces slightly less CO2 equivalent than the US average (1,150.3 lb/MWh).
