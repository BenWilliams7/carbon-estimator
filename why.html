          This calculator is an attempt to visualize and bring immediacy to the ephemeral and abstract aspects of CO<sub>2</sub> pollution. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is the single most negative factor in global warming and ocean acidification. The earth absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> is a key part of natural systems, but current emissions levels are double what the earth can absorb. The ocean absorbs a quarter of all CO<sub>2</sub>, but as it becomes increasingly acidic there will be severe consequences for marine life and less capacity to absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. The earth has the capacity to rebalance, but in order to do so there must be a drastic curb in the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that humans emit. <br><br>
          Change doesn't happen over night, and we believe that the first step is knowledge. America has long led the world in pollution per capita, and if everyone on earth polluted as much as Americans we would need 3.9 earths in order to manage the waste. There needs to be recognition that our lifestyles are not sustainable if we want to leave a functioning environment to future generations. Fortunately, even as individuals, there is lots that we can do, including driving less, eating less red meat, promoting regulations and ethical standards for industry, investing in research, and voting for <a href="https://tinyurl.com/lt4f8cm">candidates</a> who prioritize environmental issues. Our calculations focus on the CO<sub>2</sub> pollution that individuals are directly responsible for, but note that more than half of the pollution America emits is from industry. In addition to changing our own habits we would ask that you advocate for changes in how America conducts its business. We'd also ask that you not underestimate the ripple effects that small changes can lead to, changing practices en masse. <br><br>
          Beneath the titanic numbers involved in pollution, the impact of any given person can seem irrelevant. In light of legislative agendas with the temerity to question the very existence of climate change any solution can seem hopeless. Philosophical issues involving whether or not ethical consumption is even possible in a capitalist society can breed nihilism, indifference, or hopelessness. But we, as individuals and a whole, can be sheltered by what we know and can control. We know that earth cannot afford current levels of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and that we can control our personal behavior. Small steps add up to big differences. Not everyone has to become vegetarian, but we can eat meat one fewer day per week. We can ride our bike or take the bus even if we own a <a href="https://greenismything.com/2015/09/16/what-if-everyone-in-the-u-s-stopped-driving-for-one-day/">car</a>. We can shut the lights off when we leave a room and be judicious in how we heat and cool. Mostly it's that we've got one planet and we just don't get a do over if we screw it up.<br><br>

          <li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687168/">Studies</a> have shown that urbanization and corresponding vehicle emissions is correlated with an increased frequency of respiratory allergy and asthma. <br></li>
          <li>The main <a href="http://grist.org/food/protein-the-lay-of-the-lamb/">reason</a> that lambs produce more CO<sub>2</sub> than cows is because they live longer before they are at market weight because  they are not kept in feeding chambers. Lambs, like cows, produce CO<sub>2</sub> through farting and burping. A potential solution is to change animal feed, such as by increasing clover. Research could drastically curb CO<sub>2</sub> from livestock.
